# Surfs_Up

This project is to analyze the temperature statistics for June and december to see if we can run a surf shop throughout the year and remain profitable. We ran two queries to to get the temperatures for both months and store it into a dataframe. We then took this data and made it an easier to read summary.

## Results
- In June we had a mean of 74.9, a min of 64 and a max of 85

- The standard deviation from June and December only have a .5 difference

## Summary
Looking at the data we can see that the weather drops slightly into December and would be a bit cooler to surf, however still is good weather to surf on most days. There are a couple other queries that would help make a decision. One is precipitation as no one wants to surf when it is raining hard. Another is the amount of sunlight that they get during the year as that would be the most optimal conditions.
